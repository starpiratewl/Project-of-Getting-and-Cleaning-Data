# Project-of-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Project of Getting and Cleaning Data, third class of the Data Science series

This project is designed to meet the 5 goals of data manipulations

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

(Sorry for copying the contents from the coursera, which is https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project, but I really don't know how to finish this part to make it different from the cookbook.md)

The data source is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

All the procedures to achieve the goals are detailed in the cookbook.md.

All the codes are displayed in the run_analysis.R

Finally this work is done by a R newbie, if you have much smarter designs or algorithm, please let me know as soon as possible, I am available in starpiratewl@gmail.com

Thanks you!
